    <h2> Making Colors on a Screen </h2>
    <p> Since you're reading this, you passed elementary school, which means you know how to make colors out of paint: simply combine red, blue, and yellow in the right proportions, and you can have any color you want. </p>
    <p> Unfortunately, this method doesn't work on a computer. Instead, we combine red, green, and blue in various amounts in order to make the thousands of colors we see every day. (<a href="rgb.html">Why use red, green, and blue?</a></p>
    <h2> Representing Red, Green, and Blue Values </h2>
    <p> There are two main ways, then, that these values are represented for programming purposes. The first is the simplest: colors appear as rgb(34,0,89), and so on, with the first value representing red, the second green, and the third blue. Each number will be between 0 and 255, allowing for 256*256*256 = 16,777,216 different colors </p>
    <p> The second way is also pretty common, so you've likely seen it before: as a hex code. So, this could look like #220058. This is called a "hex code" because it's actually just a number, but in hex: base 16. The first two digits represent the red value, the second two represent the green value, and the last two represent the blue value. The # indicates that it's hex. So, the maximum possible value of a color would be #ffffff (<a href="hex.html">Why?</a>), or, in other words, r=255, g=255, b=255 (<a href="hex.html">Why is ff equal to 255?</a>). </p>
    <p> However, like with everything, these representations are just for the use of humans: to computers, colors are <a href="whybinary.html">represented in binary</a>. So, you can display it as three different binary numbers, each of which can be as little as 0 (00000000) or as big as 255 (11111111) (<a href="binary.html">Why is 11111111 255?</a>).
